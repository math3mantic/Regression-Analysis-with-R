# Regression-Analysis-with-R

My homework solutions (in R) of the Ph.D. level statistics course (STAT 608) in Texas A&M University.

Reference Book : A Modern Approach to Regression with R by Simon J. Sheather

Topics covered:

1) Simple Linear Regression
2) Diagnostics and Transformations for Simple Linear Regression
3) Weighted Least Squares
4) Multiple Linear Regression
5) Diagnostics and Transformations for Multiple Linear Regression
6) Variable Selection
  - R^2
  - AIC, AIC_c, BIC
  - All possible subsets
  - Stepwise (Backward Eimination, Forward Selection)
  - LASSO
  7) Logistic Regression
  8) Serially Correlated Errors (AR(1) Models)
  
  The solutions are written in LaTeX and given in pdf format. All the codes are generated in R programming language. I believe there are imperfect answers; thus, some of them needs to be improved, since this course was my first encounter with R and Statistics :)
